# Binary Decoder
Implementation of a 2 to 4 binary decoder which is used to demonstrate how it is possible to implement any n to 2^n binary decoder. Constraints file shows 3 to 8 decoder mapping while the test bench exhaustively tests a 4 to 16 decoder. The base 2 to 4 decoder is created using dataflow modelling where the equations were acquired from a truth table and then implemented.
